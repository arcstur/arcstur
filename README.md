# Hello!

## About me

I'm Artur /aɾ.'tuɾ/, software developer from Porto Alegre - Brazil, working professionally as a developer since 2022. Before that, I used to write python scripts to help me in my math classes as a teacher. Until now, I've been mostly working with web development using Django and data analysis with Pandas. My main programming languages are Python and Rust. I run a homelab with a bunch of self-hosted software, like Nextcloud, using NixOS for a declarative environment.
